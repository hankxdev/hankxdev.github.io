To use ubuntu is not a easy thing, and if you are in China, it's even more difficult. Once you want to update your ubuntu. you'd find it's very slow.
Because of some well known reason.
 
So it's better to change the update source to some mirror site in China.

Here are several famous mirror sites. What you need todo is pick one from below and edit `etc/apt/sources.list`, replace the content in this file.

**Better backup you `etc/apt/sources.list` before you do this**
